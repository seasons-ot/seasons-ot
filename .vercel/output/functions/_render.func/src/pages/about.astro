          Occupational Therapy (OT) is the art and science that helps individuals find meaning and purpose in their
          everyday activities.

          A holistic, evidence-based approach is used to problem-solve areas the individual is having difficulty with -
          i.e. self-care, productivity, and leisure. OT seeks to find the 'Just Right Challenge' - a combination of
          personal and environmental factors, as well as the activity demands so the individual can achieve full
          participation and engagement in their chosen occupations.

          Our mission is to help children and youth thrive and become <b

          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do this in two ways:<br />
          <b>1. Direct OT assessment and treatment</b><br />
          <b>2. Parent coaching and consultation</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We pride ourselves on using a family-centered, relationship and play-based approach to address your child's
          individual OT goals. Learning through play has been proven to be most effective for children as it facilitates
          engagement, curiosity, and experiential learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parent implementation of OT strategies is key to a child's progress and success. We also encourage our clients
          to nurture a growth mindset (parents too) and collaborate with the family to create and achieve meaningful
          goals.
