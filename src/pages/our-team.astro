      <p>
        Sharon is a Registered Occupational Therapist, member of the RASP (Registry of Autism Service Providers), and
        Clinical Instructor in the Department of Occupational Science & Occupational Therapy at the University of
        British Columbia. She earned her Master’s degree in Occupational Therapy from the University of Sydney,
        Australia.
      </p>

      <p>
        With over a decade of pediatric experience, Sharon is passionate about helping children and families thrive. She
        has worked in diverse roles and settings, delivering fun, engaging, and evidence-based interventions while
        collaborating closely with each child’s healthcare and educational teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sharon supports children and youth (ages 2–18) with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Attention Deficit
        Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Down Syndrome, Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), Developmental Coordination
        Disorder (DCD), Cerebral Palsy (CP), and other physical, genetic, neurological, developmental, and mental health
        conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Her approach is playful, child-centred, and grounded in evidence-based practice that incorporates developmental,
        sensory-motor, cognitive, and social-emotional principles. She also draws on her background in visual arts,
        mindfulness, music, and movement (including yoga and dance) to create meaningful and motivating therapy
        experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fluent in English and conversational in Cantonese and Mandarin, Sharon values cultural connection in her work.
        Outside the clinic, she’s often outdoors chasing the sun — hiking, camping, scuba diving, or gardening — and
        loves travelling, tea, and dark chocolate.
