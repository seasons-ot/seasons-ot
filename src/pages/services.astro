        Direct 1:1 OT sessions, with an OT or a supervised OTA (Occupational Therapy Assistant) in the child's home,
        community or preschool/daycare setting.
      </p><p>
        Session frequency will depend on the child's need, progress, and carryover of recommendations into the child's
        everyday life. Our treatments will often look like play, but embedded with therapeutic benefits of the
        'just-right challenge' to motivate and support the child's development toward their goals.
